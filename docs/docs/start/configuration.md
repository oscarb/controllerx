This is an example configuration template to place in `/config/appdaemon/apps/apps.yaml`:

```yaml
example_app:
  module: controllerx
  class: <class of your controller>
  controller: <controller entity id>
  integration: <z2m | deconz | zha>
  light: <light, group entity id>
```

or:

```yaml
example_app:
  module: controllerx
  class: <class of your controller>
  controller: <controller entity id>
  integration: <z2m | deconz | zha>
  light:
    name: <light, group entity id>
    color_mode: auto | xy_color | color_temp
```

or:

```yaml
example_app:
  module: controllerx
  class: <class of your controller>
  controller: <controller entity id>
  integration: <z2m | deconz | zha>
  media_player: <media player, group entity id>
```

or:

```yaml
example_app:
  module: controllerx
  class: <class of your controller>
  controller: <controller entity id>
  integration: <z2m | deconz | zha>
  switch: <switch, group entity id>
```

## Parameters

These are the generic app parameters for all type of controllers. You can see the rest in [here](/controllerx/start/type-configuration/).

This attribute cannot be used together with `excluded_actions`.                                                                                                                                                                  |

To see which actions has each controller check the individual controller pages in [here](/controllerx/controllers).

If the time difference between the two actions is less than this attribute, then the action won't be called. I recommend changing this if you see the same action being called twice. A different `action_delta` per action can be defined in a mapping.                                                   |
| `multiple_click_delay` | int            | 500                                               | Indicates the delay (in milliseconds) when a multiple click action should be trigger. The higher the number, the more time there can be between clicks, but there will be more delay for the action to be triggered.                                                                                                                                                                                        |

If defining a map, the key for the map is the action and the value is the delay in seconds. Otherwise, we can set a default time like `action_delay: 10`, and this will add a delay to all actions.                                                                                                             |

This is just applicable for `state` and `z2m` (with not MQTT) integrations. For example, it can be used when we want the action to be triggered only with a specific previous state.                                                                                                                |
| `mapping`              | dict           | -                                                 | This can be used to replace the behaviour of the controller and manually select what each button should be doing. By default it will ignore this parameter. Read more about it in [here](/controllerx/advanced). The functionality included in this attribute will remove the default mapping.                                                                                                        |
| `merge_mapping`        | dict           | -                                                 | This can be used to merge the default mapping from the controller and manually select what each button should be doing. By default it will ignore this parameter. Read more about it in [here](/controllerx/advanced). The functionality included in this attribute is added on top of the default mapping.                                                                                           |
| `mode`                 | dict \| int    | `single`                                          | This has the purpose of defining what to do when an ation(s) is/are executing. The options and the behaviour is the same as [Home Assistant automation modes](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/modes) since it is based on that. The only difference is that `queued` only queues 1 task after the one is being executed. One can define a mapping for each action event with different modes. |

Integration dictionary for `integration` attribute.

| key      | type   | value                    | description                                             |
| -------- | ------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`\* | string | `z2m`, `deconz` or `zha` | This is the integration that the device was integrated. |

In addition, you can add arguments. Each [integration](others/integrations) has its own arguments.

  controller: sensor.my_controller_action # or my_controller_id or 00:67:88:56:06:78:9b:3f

  # `integration` is the integration used for your controller
  # It can be used as object like:
  # integration:

  #   listen_to: mqtt
  # Check https://xaviml.github.io/controllerx/others/integrations for more info
  integration: z2m # or deconz, mqtt, zha, state

  # `actions` and `excluded_actions` can be used to indicate which actions from the default mapping
  # will be used or not. These 2 attributes cannot be used at the same time.
  actions: # or excluded_actions. This is optional.
    - toggle
    - brightness_up_click

  # `action_delta` is the threshold to avoid firing the same action twice
  action_delta: 300 # default. This is optional.

  # `multiple_click_delay` is used for the multiclick functionality
  # Check https://xaviml.github.io/controllerx/advanced/multiple-clicks for more info
  multiple_click_delay: 500 # default. This is optional.

  # `action_delay` lets you configure delays to existing actions
  action_delay: # This is optional.

  # Possible values are `single`, `restart`, `queued` and `parallel`
  mode: single # default. This is optional.

  # `mapping` and `merge_mapping` let you override the default behaviour of your controller.
  # `merge_mapping` updates the default mapping, and `mapping` overrides it completely.

      - service: script.my_script_with_arguments
        data:
